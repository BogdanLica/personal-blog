When newcomers to the security field (like myself :grin:) learn a few techniques to pwn a machine, they try to learn more and more methods, because they think their end goal is just to be root. 

Don't get me wrong, the adrenaline that you get when you do that is real and maybe your friends are impressed, but don't you want to get to the next level and use your new position to sniff around even more to try and find a new target?
