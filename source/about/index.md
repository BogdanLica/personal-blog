# Hi :wave:

I'm Bogdan and I love to build (program) and break (hack) stuff. As so, my articles are related to this, but sometimes I write about other things such as burnout :tired_face: , photography :camera: or travelling :earth_americas: .


 



## Experience

[![MWR / F-Secure Cyber Services](/../resources/mwr.png)](https://www.mwrinfosecurity.com/)
* having fun while hacking a fictitious website
* playing with z/OS for mainframes
* learning about reverse engineering on IOS


[![Countercept](/../resources/countercept.png)](https://www.countercept.com/)
* releasing a platform in production
* building pipelines in Gitlab
* playing with ElasticSearch and Zabbix




## Interests
### Photography :camera:

I have been doing photography for a couple of years by now in different forms such as:
* event photography
* portraits
* landscapes
* architecture

### Dancing :dancers:

I do it from time to time (DISCLAIMER: I am the worst)

### Cars :car:

What can I say, that is a happy fellow :satisfied:
